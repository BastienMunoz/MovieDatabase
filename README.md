# Movie Database

Movie Database is an application that can browse movies (sorted by popularity) and displays some details about movies
This project uses the [The Movie Database API v3](https://developers.themoviedb.org/)
In order to be able to run the project an API key must be acquired (for free) through to above link


## Why did I start this project?
* I wanted to make a project that shows the concepts I know about Android development
* This project will also help me to try/experiment new things about Android development
* I don't intend to publish the application on the Google Play for the moment as feature-wise it's lacking


## Next steps
* Write unit tests
* Make a compose version (through a dedicated branch)
* Save results in a local database (with Room for example)
* Create a search functionality
* Create a sort functionality (current sort is by popularity)
